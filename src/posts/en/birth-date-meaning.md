## 🔢 Numerology and Birth Date Meaning

**Numerology** assigns significance to the numbers in your birth date. One popular method is calculating your **Life Path Number**, which is believed to describe your core purpose in life.

### ✨ Example:

For someone born on **July 19, 1995**, the Life Path calculation would be:

`7 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 41 → 4 + 1 = 5`  
➡️ Life Path Number = **5** (freedom, adaptability, communication)

Each number from 1 to 9 (and master numbers 11, 22, 33) carries a different vibration and meaning.
